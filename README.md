#Introduction
-Using the Naive Bayes technique to analyze the words in emails to check the words' relationship and paterns

#Data Cleaning
-Slide the words in the emails to count
-Remove the non-alphabetic words
-Remove the words that have frequency that is lower 3000

#Adding features
-Create table
-Label the words and express the count
-Identify spam messages
-Lay out with the structure that Naive Bayes test can be applied

#Conclusion
From the accuracy of 96.15%, the Naive Bayes show the independent relationships between words. Based on the high freqency words, they do not have much relationship to other words. When one word appears in that email, there will not be another word that always in the same sentence; the other words will be random. The system suggests that we cannot predict the outcome of having set of words that always go together.
